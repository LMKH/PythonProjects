# Meal Planner + Contents
For when you need a little help figuring out what to eat! The user gets prompted with a menu of food recipes. The user simply must input the number corresponding to the recipe they wish to cook. If they select "Butter Chicken" (1) for example, the programme will take the information from the contents.py file and return to the user what they have with an "OK". The user presses 0 to quit the programme and a message specifying what it is they need to buy. In this case, 250g of chicken, 1 piece of ginger and 115g of tomato puree.

Works with the contents.py file. In the contents.py file, you will find the ingredients inside the pantry and the recipes.
